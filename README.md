# 3D-UMAP-Visualization-plus
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to generate and visualize 3D UMAP projections from single-cell RNA-seq data using Python. The notebook uses the Scanpy framework and Matplotlib's 3D plotting features to produce high-quality 3D scatter plots, with customized color mappings and legends based on cell annotations.
